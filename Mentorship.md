**General FAQs**
-------------

1.	What is the Mentorship Programme?
Going through IB, the first two batches didn’t have a lot of guidance from any alumni regarding the school or the teachers. In order to help new students and make contact between students and alumni easier. Using the data from the student and volunteer alumni the mentorship programme heads pair up each student with an alumni.
2.	Who can I contact for a change in mentor?
You can email mentorship@abwaalumni.com or to info@abwaalumni.com and we will help out with the same.
3.	How long does the mentor stay with you for?

**Indian Colleges**

1.	How hard is the transition from IB to the Indian Board?
The shift is more often than not easy, the heavy IB work load doesn’t compare to the work load in college however most people take on more activities within college and at an office in order to make up for the work load as well as build up a resume.
2.	How difficult is the admission process for an IB student?
It various from person to person, grades and extra-curricular activities play a large role in the admissions in colleges, this is something which should be discussed with the principal of the college and the counsellor in school.
3.	What IB grade is considered ideal for an IB student applying to an Indian college?
The grade conversion from IB to Indian colleges is tricky. It follows a chart (will be linked here soon) which is accessible from the school counsellor, which will come in handy when the predictive grades are being decided.

**US**

1.	When should you start applying?
Typically the applications open in the first week of August for the Common Application and by the end of September for all other individual applications. 
2.	What are required tests I would have to give?
Most school require the SAT or the ACT, either one of them will do, the average score required for each school would depend on the admissions department of the university as well as the major which you are applying for. Along with that IB English is good course for English Proficiency skills, however a few schools ask for the TOEFL or the IELTS exams.

6.	When does the Common App open and what is the deadline to submit it?
The Common App opens in the first week of August and the deadlines depend on the universities, and the type of application, a few have “Early Admission”, “Early Decision” or “Rolling Admissions”

**UK**

1.	How long is the college program?
Course durations vary, however the typical number of years are usually 3, or 4 (with experience in industry). The reason is that study in UK is focused and delves directly into the subject of interest. In the US, I believe, the course structure is such, that a multi-subject initiative is taken in the first year, allowing students to specialise only from second and third years. It is important, though, to remember that the former has stricter flexibility about changing subjects as compared to the latter. 

2.	What is a conditional offer?
As the name suggests, it is an offer with specified conditions that an applicant must achieve in order to have a confirmed offer. In the rare case of a student having absolutely brilliant credentials, the college might give them an “unconditional offer”, in which case the student’s entry into the college is secured. However, as in most cases in the UK, colleges will give conditional offers to students based on their IB preliminary examination grades and additionally, their CV. The conditions must be met as a result of the final examination grades, which must directly be sent from the IBDP HQ to the college (an IB initiative caters to that).
>**TIP**: In the case of not meeting the conditions by nominal margins, colleges aren’t always very stringent about their offers if the student proves themselves to be worth a chance.
